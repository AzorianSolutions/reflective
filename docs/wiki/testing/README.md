## Testing Guide

I don't have a lot of information to put here yet, but I will eventually.

Tests are written using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/). The tests are kept in the `src/tests` directory.
A formal organization structure has not been established yet, but this will be addressed soon.

For now, here's how to run the tests.

### TL;DR

```bash
python3 -m pip install pytest
python3 -m pytest -v
```
