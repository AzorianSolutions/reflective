# Reflective

## Development Guide

An in-depth guide on the library's design and development will hopefully be here sooner than later.
That's all I can offer currently.

### Environment Set Up

To set up your environment to perform changes to the Reflective code-base, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade git+
git clone https://github.com/AzorianSolutions/reflective.git
cd reflective
git checkout dev
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -e .
```
